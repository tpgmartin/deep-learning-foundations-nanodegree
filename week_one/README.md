# Week One

Gradient descent to minimise cost funciton

## Intro to Neural Networks

Perceptrons are individual nodes of a neural network 

Bias: Adding or subtracting to the line will move the line up or down
Weights: Changing the weights will affect the slope of the line

## Gradient Descent

Want the network's prediction error to be as small as possible by adjusting 
the weights. Find weights that minimisee the squared error.
